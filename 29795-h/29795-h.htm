<p>
They who maintained their rights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through storm and stress,</span><br />
And walked in all the ways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That God made known,</span><br />
Led by no wandering lights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by no guess,</span><br />
Through dark and desolate days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of trial and moan:</span><br />
Here let their monument<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rise, like a word</span><br />
In rock commemorative<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 2]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of our Land's youth;</span><br />
Of ways the Puritan went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With soul love-spurred</span><br />
To suffer, die, and live<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For faith and truth.</span><br />
Here they the corner-stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Freedom laid;</span><br />
Here in their hearts' distress<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They lit the lights</span><br />
Of Liberty alone;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here, with God's aid,</span><br />
Conquered the wilderness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Secured their rights.</span><br />
Not men, but giants, they,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who wrought with toil</span><br />
And sweat of brawn and brain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their freehold here;</span><br />
Who, with their blood, each day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hallowed the soil.</span><br />
And left it without stain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And without fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">II.</span></p>

<p>Yea; here, from men like these,<br />
Our country had its stanch beginning;<br />
Hence sprang she with the ocean breeze<br />
And pine scent in her hair;<br />
Deep in her eyes the winning,<br />
The far-off winning of the unmeasured West;<br />
And in her heart the care,<br />
The young unrest,<br />
Of all that she must dare,<br />
Ere as a mighty Nation she should stand<br />
Towering from sea to sea,<br />
From land to mountained land,<br />
One with the imperishable beauty of the stars<br />
In absolute destiny;<br />
Part of that cosmic law, no shadow mars,<br />
To which all freedom runs,<br />
That wheels the circles of the worlds and suns<br />
Along their courses through the vasty night,<br />
Irrevocable and eternal as is Light.</p>

<p>What people has to-day<br />
Such faith as launched and sped,<br />
With psalm and prayer, the Mayflower on its way?&mdash;<br />
Such faith as led<br />
The Dorchester fishers to this sea-washed point,<br />
This granite headland of Cape Ann?<br />
Where first they made their bed,<br />
Salt-blown and wet with brine,<br />
In cold and hunger, where the storm-wrenched pine<br />
Clung to the rock with desperate footing. They,<br />
With hearts courageous whom hope did anoint,<br />
Despite their tar and tan,<br />
Worn of the wind and spray,<br />
Seem more to me than man,<br />
With their unconquerable spirits.&mdash;Mountains may<br />
Succumb to men like these, to wills like theirs,&mdash;<br />
The Puritan's tenacity to do;<br />
The stubbornness of genius;&mdash;holding to<br />
Their purpose to the end,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 5]</span>No New-World hardship could deflect or bend;&mdash;<br />
That never doubted in their worst despairs,<br />
But steadily on their way<br />
Held to the last, trusting in God, who filled<br />
Their souls with fire of faith that helped them build<br />
A country, greater than had ever thrilled<br />
Man's wildest dreams, or entered in<br />
His highest hopes. 'Twas this that helped them win<br />
In spite of danger and distress,<br />
Through darkness and the din<br />
Of winds and waves, unto a wilderness,<br />
Savage, unbounded, pathless as the sea,<br />
That said, "Behold me! I am free!"<br />
Giving itself to them for greater things<br />
Than filled their souls with dim imaginings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">IV.</span></p>

<p>Let History record their stalwart names,<br />
And catalogue their fortitude, whence grew,<br />
Swiftly as running flames,<br />
Cities and civilization:<br />
How from a meeting-house and school,<br />
A few log-huddled cabins, Freedom drew<br />
Her rude beginnings. Every pioneer station,<br />
Each settlement, though primitive of tool,<br />
Had in it then the making of a Nation;<br />
Had in it then the roofing of the plains<br />
With traffic; and the piercing through and through<br />
Of forests with the iron veins<br />
Of industry.<br />
Would I could make you see<br />
How these, laboriously,<br />
These founders of New England, every hour<br />
Faced danger, death, and misery,<br />
Conquering the wilderness;<br />
With supernatural power<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 7]</span>Changing its features; all its savage glower<br />
Of wild barbarity, fierce hate, duress,<br />
To something human, something that could bless<br />
Mankind with peace and lift its heart's elation;<br />
Something at last that stood<br />
For universal brotherhood,<br />
Astonishing the world, a mighty Nation,<br />
Hewn from the solitude.&mdash;<br />
Iron of purpose as of faith and daring,<br />
And of indomitable will,<br />
With axe and hymn-book still I see them faring,<br />
The Saxon Spirit of Conquest at their side<br />
With sword and flintlock; still I see them stride,<br />
As to some Roundhead rhyme,<br />
Adown the aisles of Time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">V.</span></p>

<p>Can praise be simply said of such as these?<br />
Such men as Standish, Winthrop, Endicott?<br />
Such souls as Roger Conant and John White?<br />
Rugged and great as trees,<br />
The oaks of that New World with which their lot<br />
Was cast forever, proudly to remain.<br />
That world in which each name still stands, a light<br />
To beacon the Ship of State through stormy seas.<br />
Can praise be simply said<br />
Of him, the younger Vane,<br />
Puritan and patriot,<br />
Whose dedicated head<br />
Was laid upon the block<br />
In thy name, Liberty!<br />
Can praise be simply said of such as he!<br />
Needs must the soul unlock<br />
All gates of eloquence to sing of these.<br />
Such periods,<br />
Such epic melodies,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 9]</span>As holds the utterance of the earlier gods,<br />
The lords of song, one needs<br />
To sing the praise of these!<br />
No feeble music, tinklings frail of glass;<br />
No penny trumpetings; twitterings of brass,<br />
The moment's effort, shak'n from pigmy bells,<br />
Ephemeral drops from small Pierian wells,<br />
With which the Age relieves a barren hour.<br />
But such large music, such melodious power,<br />
As have our cataracts,<br />
Pouring the iron facts,<br />
The giant acts<br />
Of these: such song as have our rock-ridged deep<br />
And mountain steeps,<br />
When winds, like clanging eagles, sweep the storm<br />
On tossing wood and farm:<br />
Such eloquence as in the torrent leaps,&mdash;<br />
Where the hoarse canyon sleeps,<br />
Holding the heart with its terrific charm,<br />
Carrying its roaring message to the town,&mdash;<br />
To voice their high achievement and renown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">VI.</span></p>

<p>Long, long ago, beneath heaven's stormy slope,<br />
In deeds of faith and hope,<br />
Our fathers laid Freedom's foundations here,<br />
And raised, invisible, vast,&mdash;<br />
Embodying naught of doubt or fear,<br />
A monument whose greatness shall outlast<br />
The future, as the past,<br />
Of all the Old World's dynasties and kings.&mdash;<br />
A symbol of all things<br />
That we would speak, but cannot say in words,<br />
Of those who first began our Nation here,<br />
Behold, we now would rear!<br />
A different monument! a thought, that girds<br />
Itself with granite; dream made visible<br />
In rock and bronze to tell<br />
To all the Future what here once befell;<br />
Here where, unknown to them,<br />
A tree took root; a tree of wondrous stem;<br />
The tree of high ideals, which has grown,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span>And has not withered since its seed was sown,<br />
Was planted here by them in this new soil,<br />
Who watered it with tears and blood and toil:<br />
An heritage we mean to hold,<br />
Keeping it stanch and beautiful as of old.&mdash;<br />
For never a State,<br />
Or People, yet was great<br />
Without its great ideals;&mdash;branch and root<br />
Of the deep tree of life where bud and blow<br />
The dreams, the thoughts, that grow<br />
To deeds, the glowing fruit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">VII.</span></p>

<p>The morn, that breaks its heart of gold<br />
Above the purple hills;<br />
The eve, that spills<br />
Its nautilus splendor where the sea is rolled;<br />
The night, that leads the vast procession in<br />
Of stars and dreams,&mdash;<br />
The beauty that shall never die or pass:&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span>The winds, that spin<br />
Of rain the misty mantles of the grass,<br />
And thunder-raiment of the mountain-streams;<br />
The sunbeams, needling with gold the dusk<br />
Green cowls of ancient woods;<br />
The shadows, thridding, veiled with musk,<br />
The moon-pathed solitudes,<br />
Call to my Fancy, saying, "Follow! follow!"<br />
Till, following, I see,&mdash;<br />
Fair as a cascade in a rainbowed hollow,&mdash;<br />
A dream, a shape, take form,<br />
Clad on with every charm,&mdash;<br />
The vision of that Ideality,<br />
Which lured the pioneer in wood and hill,<br />
And beckoned him from earth and sky;<br />
The dream that cannot die,<br />
Their children's children did fulfill.<br />
In stone and iron and wood,<br />
Out of the solitude,<br />
And by a forthright act<br />
Create a mighty fact&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span>A Nation, now that stands<br />
Clad on with hope and beauty, strength and song,<br />
Eternal, young, and strong,<br />
Planting her heel on Wrong,<br />
Her starry banner in triumphant hands....<br />
Within her face the rose<br />
Of Alleghany dawns;<br />
Limbed with Alaskan snows,<br />
Floridian starlight in her eyes,&mdash;<br />
Eyes stern as steel yet tender as a fawn's,&mdash;<br />
And in her hair<br />
The rapture of her rivers; and the dare,<br />
As perishless as truth,<br />
That o'er the crags of her Sierras flies,<br />
Urging the eagle ardor through her veins,<br />
Behold her where,<br />
Around her radiant youth,<br />
The spirits of the cataracts and plains,<br />
The genii of the floods and forests, meet,<br />
In rainbow mists circling her brow and feet:<br />
The forces vast that sit<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 14]</span>In session round her; powers paraclete,<br />
That guard her presence; awful forms and fair.<br />
Making secure her place;<br />
Guiding her surely as the worlds through space<br />
Do laws sidereal; edicts, thunder-lit,<br />
Of skyed eternity, in splendor borne<br />
On planetary wings of night and morn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">VIII.</span></p>

<p>Behold her! this is she!<br />
Beautiful as morning on the summer sea,<br />
Yet terrible as is the elemental gold<br />
That cleaves the tempest and in angles clings<br />
About its cloudy temples.&mdash;Manifold<br />
The dreams of daring in her fearless gaze,<br />
Fixed on the future's days;<br />
And round her brow, a strand of astral beads,<br />
Her soul's resplendent deeds;<br />
And at her front one star,<br />
Refulgent hope,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]</span>Like that on morning's slope,<br />
Beaconing the world afar.&mdash;<br />
From her high place she sees<br />
Her long procession of accomplished acts.<br />
Cloud-wing'd refulgences<br />
Of thoughts in steel and stone, of marble dreams,<br />
Lift up tremendous battlements,<br />
Sun-blinding, built of facts;<br />
While in her soul she seems,<br />
Listening, to hear, as from innumerable tents,<br />
&AElig;onian thunder, wonder, and applause<br />
Of all the heroic ages that are gone;<br />
Feeling secure<br />
That, as her Past, her Future shall endure,<br />
As did her Cause<br />
When redly broke the dawn<br />
Of fierce rebellion, and, beneath its star,<br />
The firmaments of war<br />
Poured down infernal rain,<br />
And North and South lay bleeding 'mid their slain.<br />
And now, no less, shall her Cause still prevail,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]</span>More so in peace than war,<br />
Through the thrilled wire and electric rail,<br />
Carrying her message far;<br />
Shaping her dream<br />
Within the brain of steam,<br />
That, with a myriad hands,<br />
Labors unceasingly, and knits her lands<br />
In firmer union; joining plain and stream<br />
With steel; and binding shore to shore<br />
With bands of iron;&mdash;nerves and arteries,<br />
Along whose adamant forever pour<br />
Her concrete thoughts, her tireless energies.</p>

<h1><i>On Old Cape Ann</i></h1>


<p class="center">I.</p>

<p class="center">ANNISQUAM</p>

<div class="poem">Old days, old ways, old homes beside the sea;<br />
Old gardens with old-fashioned flowers aflame,<br />
Poppy, petunia, and many a name<br />
Of many a flower of fragrant pedigree.<br />
Old hills that glow with blue- and barberry,<br />
And rocks and pines that stand on guard, the same.<br />
Immutable, as when the Pilgrim came,<br />
And here laid firm foundations of the Free.<br />
The sunlight makes the dim dunes hills of snow,<br />
And every vessel's sail a twinkling wing<br />
Glancing the violet ocean far away:<br />
The world is full of color and of glow;<br />
A mighty canvas whereon God doth fling<br />
The flawless picture of a perfect day.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p class="center">"THE HIGHLANDS," ANNISQUAM</p>

<div class="poem">Here, from the heights, among the rocks and pines,<br />
The sea and shore seem some tremendous page<br />
Of some vast book, great with our heritage,<br />
Breathing the splendor of majestic lines.<br />
Yonder the dunes speak silver; yonder shines<br />
The ocean's sapphire word; there, gray with age,<br />
The granite writes its lesson, strong and sage;<br />
And there the surf its rhythmic passage signs.<br />
The winds, that sweep the page, that interlude<br />
Its majesty with music; and the tides,<br />
That roll their thunder in, that period<br />
Its mighty rhetoric, deep and dream-imbued,<br />
Are what it seems to say, of what abides,<br />
Of what's eternal, and of what is God.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p class="center">III.</p>

<p class="center">STORM AT ANNISQUAM</p>

<div class="poem">The sun sinks scarlet as a barberry.<br />
Far off at sea one vessel lifts a sail,<br />
Hurrying to harbor from the coming gale,<br />
That banks the west above a choppy sea.<br />
The sun is gone; the tide is flowing free;<br />
The bay is opaled with wild light; and pale<br />
The lighthouse spears its flame now; through a veil<br />
That falls about the sea mysteriously.<br />
Out there she sits and mutters of her dead,<br />
Old Ocean; of the stalwart and the strong,<br />
Skipper and fisher whom her arms dragged down:<br />
Before her now she sees their ghosts; o'erhead,<br />
As gray as rain, their wild wrecks sweep along,<br />
And all night long lay siege to this old town.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p class="center">IV.</p>

<p class="center">FROM COVE TO COVE</p>

<div class="poem">The road leads up a hill through many a brake,<br />
Blueberry and barberry, bay and sassafras,<br />
By an abandoned quarry, where, like glass,<br />
A round pool lies; an isolated lake,<br />
A mirror for what presences, that make<br />
Their wildwood toilets here! The road is grass<br />
Gray-scarred with stone: great bowlders, as we pass,<br />
Slope burly shoulders towards us. Cedars shake<br />
Wild balsam from their tresses; there and here<br />
Clasping a glimpse of ocean and of shore<br />
In arms of swaying green. Below, at last,<br />
Beside the sea, with derrick and with pier,<br />
By heaps of granite, noise of drill and bore,<br />
A Cape Ann town, towering with many a mast.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p class="center">V.</p>

<p class="center">PASTURES BY THE SEA</p>

<div class="poem">Here where the coves indent the shore and fall<br />
And fill with ebb and flowing of the tides;<br />
Whereon some barge rocks or some dory rides,<br />
By which old orchards bloom, or, from the wall,<br />
Pelt every lane with fruit; where gardens, tall<br />
With roses, riot; swift my gladness glides<br />
To that old pasture where the mushroom hides,<br />
The chicory blooms and Peace sits mid them all.<br />
Fenced in with rails and rocks, its emerald slopes,&mdash;<br />
Ribbed with huge granite,&mdash;where the placid cows<br />
Tinkle a browsing bell, roll to a height<br />
Wherefrom the sea, bright as adventuring hopes,<br />
Swept of white sails and plowed of foaming prows,<br />
Leaps like a Nereid on the ravished sight.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p class="center">VI.</p>

<p class="center">THE DUNES</p>

<div class="poem">Far as the eye can see, in domes and spires,<br />
Buttress and curve, ruins of shifting sand,&mdash;<br />
In whose wild making wind and sea took hand,&mdash;<br />
The white dunes stretch. The wind, that never tires,<br />
Striving for strange effects that he admires,<br />
Changes their form from time to time; the land<br />
Forever passive to his mad demand,<br />
And to the sea's, who with the wind conspires.<br />
Here, as on towers of desolate cities, bay<br />
And wire-grass grow, wherein no insect cries,<br />
Only a bird, the swallow of the sea,<br />
That homes in sand. I hear it far away<br />
Crying&mdash;or is it some lost soul that flies,<br />
Above the land, ailing unceasingly?</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p class="center">VII.</p>

<p class="center">BY THE SUMMER SEA</p>

<div class="poem">Sunlight and shrill cicada and the low,<br />
Slow, sleepy kissing of the sea and shore,<br />
And rumor of the wind. The morning wore<br />
A sullen face of fog that lifted slow,<br />
Letting her eyes gleam through of grayest glow;<br />
Wearing a look like that which once she wore<br />
When, Gloucesterward from Dogtown there, they bore<br />
Some old witchwife with many a gibe and blow.<br />
But now the day has put off every care,<br />
And sits at peace beside the smiling sea,<br />
Dreaming bright dreams with lazy-lidded eyes:<br />
One is a castle, precipiced in air,<br />
And one a golden galleon&mdash;can it be<br />
'Tis but the cloudworld of the sunset skies?</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
